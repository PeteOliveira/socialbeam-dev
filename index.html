<h3>Getting Started on Socialbeam</h3>

<p>As you might already know Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.So I chose RAILS for development of this project
for the ease of creating a really good scalable WEB Application like Social Network. I am myself a beginner in Rails and you can
catch me with details tutorials of SOCIALBEAM on my website <a href="http://www.raycoding.net">www.raycoding.net</a> 
You can follow the tutorials alongside the Source Code ==&gt; <a href="http://raycoding.net/category/ruby-on-rails/socialbeam-development-tutorial/">http://raycoding.net/category/ruby-on-rails/socialbeam-development-tutorial/</a>
If you need guide starting up with RAILS you can always check </p>

<ul>
<li>The Getting Started Guide: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a>
</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book: <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">http://www.railstutorial.org/</a>
</li>
</ul><p>The project - SOCIALBEAM</p>

<p>Currently running on RVM with Ruby Enterprize Edition REE 1.8.7 and Rails 3.2.8,MySQL, Apache2 - Passenger Rails to follow the project. I would suggest you to get your system setup with the following configurations. You can find many Official Guide to get your System set up with these requirement.Also you can find setup tutorials on my website <a href="http://www.raycoding.net">www.raycoding.net</a> for SocialBeam.
The Project is at it's initial development stage and I am sole developer, I would love anyone to contribute to Socialbeam.
With time I will try and prepare a documentation too for the same. Socialbeam like any other Social Network like Facebook , Twitter would first aim to implement the basic features of a Social Network with User(Beamers) connected to each other with social shares and streams. </p>

<p>A little about Development Environment of SocialBeam on Rails</p>

<p>== Console</p>

<p>The console is a Ruby shell, which allows you to interact with your
application's domain model. Here you'll have all parts of the application
configured, just like it is when the application is running. You can inspect
domain models, change values, and save to the database. Starting the script
without arguments will launch it in the development environment.</p>

<p>To start the console, run 'rails console' from the Socialbeam's application
directory.</p>

<p>It often happens while your console is loaded you make changes to your MVC,so to reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
reload!</p>

<p>== dbconsole - NOTE I WILL ADD THE schema.rb and seed.rb for you to get the db in your local system too with all data.</p>

<p>You can go to the command line of your database directly through rails
dbconsole. You would be connected to the database with the credentials
defined in - Socialbeam's database.yml. Starting the script without arguments will connect you
to the development database.</p>

<p>== Directory Architechture of SocialBeam App:
app
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.</p>

<p>app/assets
  Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>app/controllers
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.</p>

<p>app/models
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from
  ActiveRecord::Base by default.</p>

<p>app/views
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use
  eRuby syntax by default.</p>

<p>app/views/layouts
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
  using the <tt>layout :default</tt> and create a file named default.html.erb.
  Inside default.html.erb, call &lt;% yield %&gt; to render the view using this
  layout.</p>

<p>app/helpers
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are
  generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.
  Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.</p>

<p>config
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,
  and other dependencies.</p>

<p>db
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the
  sequence of Migrations for your schema.</p>

<p>doc
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when
  generated using <tt>rake doc:app</tt></p>

<p>lib
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in
  the load path.</p>

<p>public
  The directory available for the web server. Also contains the dispatchers and the
  default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web
  server.</p>

<p>script
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.</p>

<p>test
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
  directory.</p>

<p>vendor
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins
  subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under
  vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.</p>
